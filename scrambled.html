    <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1 ounce of Cream</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the eggs: Whisk 2 large eggs, 1 pinch of kosher salt, 1 grind of black pepper and 2 tablespoons
             whole milk together until light and foamy.</li>

        <li>Add to the pan: Add 1 tablespoon unsalted butter to a 10-to-12-inch nonstick skillet and put it over high heat.
             When the butter bubbles (after about a minute),
             pour the eggs straight into the middle of the pan,
              which will force the butter to the edges, where it's needed.</li>

        <li>Scramble the eggs: Stir slowly with a rubber or silicone spatula.
             As soon as curds (big soft lumps) of eggs begin to form, drop the heat to low and shift from stirring to folding
              the curds over on themselves while gently shaking the pan with the other hand.</li>
    </ol>
